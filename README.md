# 🧠 Job Scraper Bot
This project is a Python-based web scraper that collects job postings from multiple tech company career pages in Israel.  
It stores job data in a SQLite database and sends daily email alerts with newly found listings.
🧡 I created this bot to help my boyfriend, Uriel, find junior tech jobs more easily - automating the daily grind of browsing career pages.  
👨‍💻 Uriel is now actively contributing to the project by adding functionality for job application submission directly from the platform.
